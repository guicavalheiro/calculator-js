# Calculator-js

This calculator was created to help me improve my webdev skills.


Here is my source of inspiration for this code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified 

And the github of the official project        : https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator/blob/master/script.js
